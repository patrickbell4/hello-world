A little about myself...

I am a student majoring in Computer Science. I have a passion for learning, especially new programming languages. So far I have studied C++, Java, Visual Basic, and Python. If had to choose one, I would say Python is my favorite language. The language is just natural and intuitive. I am also very interested in Cyber Security. I actually hope to start a career in Cyber Security after I graduate.
